# Space Shooter ðŸ‘¾

Little top down space shooter game created with C++ and [SDL3](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/FrontPage)

The idea of this project for me was to learn more about C++, libraries like SDL3 and creating a game more from scratch. The game idea itself isn't something crazy, but that is not the point of this project.

## Updates
- Refactoring + bug fixing
- Highscore/save system
- Sprites
- Sounds
- Animations?
